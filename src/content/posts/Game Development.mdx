For this unit, we built games using Construct. To get started, I followed the
Construct tutorial, linked to by Ms. Horricks. The tutorial showed me how to 
build and alien-fighting game.

After building this game, the next assignment was to either expand on this game,
or build an entirely new one. I chose to build a new game, since I found it fun 
to make games.

Although I liked working with Construct, I decided to use a more advanced tool
to develop games. In particular, I found Game Maker Studio 2 to suit my needs 
after a classmate recommmended it to me.

The game I build was based off of the classic game Asteroids, but with a spin
to it.

I added recoil to the gun, which pushed the ship back when fired. I also added
a shotgun which sprayed bullets, but added a cooldown to it to keep the game 
balanced.

The bar on the top-left is the cooldown for the shotgun.
