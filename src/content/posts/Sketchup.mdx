For this assignment, we built a house in Twinmotion, and made a tour-style
video, showing the viewer around the house.

I decided to go above-and-beyond, and build the house from scratch in an 
architectural CAD named Sketchfab. Unfortunately, I had technical difficulties
when tryimg to import the house into Twinmotion. Some polygons would be transparent,
and the house model was so large that it rendered Twinmotion unusable.

So, instead of making a tour video, I took pictures of the house. It is unfortunate
that I couldn't import the house, but this is the best I can do.
