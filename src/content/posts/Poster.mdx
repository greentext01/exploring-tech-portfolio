For this assignment, we made a poster for Black History Month. This poster
celebrates the accomplishments and contributions of a Black Canadian. We
needed to have a simplistic drawing of the figure, and also a short text on
their achievenemnts.

For this assignment, I made a poster of Alphonso Davies, a Black Canadian 
soccer player.
