For this unit, Ms. Horricks let me teach her class! It was such an amazing experience
teaching this many people. I had always wanted to try teaching a class, and Ms. Horricks
gave me the opportunity to do so.


I wrote this class to be as engaging as I could make it, and at the same time teach
as much computer science as I could fit in one week. Taking inspiration from CS50,
I organised the course into "days", where each "day" would cover enough concepts for
students to be able to make something substantially more complex than what they could
on the previous day. Thay way, my classmates would be motivated by their improvemnt,
and their vision that one day, they could write an application as complex as the ones
they use every day.

The result was that many of my classmates got engaged in the course, to the point 
of asking for extra work. I hope that some of my classmates will pick up programming
as a hobby, which will drive them to study past what I taught them.
