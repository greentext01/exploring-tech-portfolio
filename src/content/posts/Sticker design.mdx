For this assignment, we made stickers using a graphic design program. Most students
used Adobe Illustrator, but I decided to use a tool called Figma, since I was
already familliar with it. Figma is a tool often used in web design, to build
the layout and styles of a webpage graphically.

The sticker I made was a diagram of LeNet-5. LeNet-5 was made in 1998, and was one
of the earliest convolutional neural networks, an architecture of neural networks which
uses convolutions ("filters") to map over an image, to make it more recognisable by
the network. This network in particular is designed to recognize handwritten
digits on a 32x32 canvas. After its development, this network prmoted the development
of deep-learning, showcasing the potential of it.
