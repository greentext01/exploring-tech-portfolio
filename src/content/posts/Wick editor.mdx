For this assignment, we made animations using an open source tool called
the Wick editor. This tool was designed to be a modern Flash replacement.
It can make animations, and has many fearures relating to it. It can also
make games, and I used Wick to make one for the culminating activity.

Firstly, learned how Wick works using tutorials:

Then, for my final assignment, I made Flappy Bird!
