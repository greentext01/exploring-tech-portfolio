For this assignment, we took photos according to composition guidelines. 
Some of these photos were taken in my free time, outside of Lisgar.

I found this assignment interesting because I never knew how to take a good
photo. I would just "eyeball it", which would always result in a mediocre image.
This unit has taught me a lot about the different settings of a camera,
how to compose an image, and how to have fun taking pictures!

## Background blur
These pictures have the background blurred, to allow the viewer to focus on the subject.
The background blur was added in Lightroom, after taking the picture.

## Rule of thirds

for a more visually appealing photo.
