import ModelDisplay from "../../components/ModelDisplay.tsx"

For the class, we had to make a portfolio website. Most people used Google sites to make it, but I decided to code it "from scratch".

To make this easier, I used a relatively new web framework called Astro. This framework is perfect
for blog-like websites, such as this one, since (without getting into the details) it generates the HTML in advance, 
instead of "rendering" it from a Javascript package sent to the browser, leading to a faster response time, and less 
loading after recieving the page (Read more about it here: 
[Visual Explanation and Comparison of CSR, SSR, SSG and ISR](https://dev.to/pahanperera/visual-explanation-and-comparison-of-csr-ssr-ssg-and-isr-34ea)). 
The framework also has methods to reuse more code, such as components and templates

Coding a website makes it much faster than using Google Sites, or using any other website maker.

Unlike the home page, the blog posts aren't written in HTML; they are written in MDX. 
MDX is a variant of Markdown, with support for some more advanced features (such as the 3D viewer, explained later).

Markdown is like HTML; they both describe the contents of a website. HTML has tags, and looks more visually crowded, unless if you are used to it.
Markdown, on the other hand, looks simpler, with more intuitive syntax.

I also made the 3d viewer using code, and used libraries like Three.js to show the model.

To add the 3d viewer to a post, Markdown, since it is simple by design, has no clean way of doing this.
This is where MDX comes in. It enables me to add regular HTML (among other things), and embed a custom-made 3d viewer into the post.

Here's a demo of the 3d viewer, showing Blender's Suzanne
