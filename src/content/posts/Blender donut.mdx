To learn about 3d modelling, I made this donut in Blender, by following Blender Guru's tutorial.
The sprinkles are made using geometry nodes, without placing each and every one individually.

In the original model, the color of each sprinkle is chosen at random within a set of colors, but when I exported the model, they were all of one color.

You can see the rendered image here:

You can also see the 3d model here:
<ModelDisplay client:only="react" model_path="/models/Donut.glb" environment="sunset" />
